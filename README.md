# K-Means Cover Art Generator

## Sumedh Surya Garimella (hdemusg)

### Why did I make this?
As a musician, I wanted to try to make more minimalistic cover art for my music. 

I'm also currently started a football/soccer blog with some of my friends, and wanted to be able to change images of gameplay to look unique and gather interest in our articles.

### What does this do?
It currently takes in an image file, a number of clusters, and a threshold of change in centroid locations, and performs K-Means clustering on the color values (RGB) of each pixel to generate a new image. 

### Examples
Examples coming soon. 

### What's next?
1. Improve documentation.
2. Add support for changing the colors from the generated cluster colors.
3. Make a web version of this.
